# Khan Academy Question Scraper - FIXED VERSION

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

The scraper has been successfully fixed and is now working! Here's what was resolved:

### 1. **JSON Download Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
- **Problem**: Questions weren't being saved as JSON files
- **Root Cause**: The assessment item data was nested in `assessmentItem.item` instead of directly in `assessmentItem`
- **Solution**: Updated the data extraction logic to look in the correct nested structure

### 2. **Authentication Headers** ‚úÖ FIXED  
- **Problem**: 403 Forbidden errors when making active GraphQL requests
- **Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect authentication headers
- **Solution**: Enhanced header extraction from browser requests, including proper `x-ka-fkey` handling

### 3. **Passive Data Capture** ‚úÖ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Only active fetching was attempted, which often failed
- **Solution**: Enhanced passive capture to save questions that are already loaded by the browser

### 4. **Terminal Feedback** ‚úÖ ADDED
- **Problem**: No visibility into what was happening during scraping
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive logging with `[MITM]`, `[SAVE]`, and `[ERROR]` prefixes

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Start
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the scraper
python main.py
```

### For Section Browsing
```bash
# Navigate to a Khan Academy section (e.g., Math > Class 1)
# The scraper will automatically detect and scrape all exercises in that section
python main.py
```

## üìä What You'll See

When running successfully, you'll see output like:
```
[mitmproxy] [MITM] Detected practice manifest operation: getOrCreatePracticeTask
[mitmproxy] [MITM] Found 7 new question IDs. Actively fetching now...
