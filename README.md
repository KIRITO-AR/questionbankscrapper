# Khan Academy Question Scraper - Autonomous Version# Khan Academy Question Bank Scraper



This repository contains a fully autonomous Khan Academy question scraper with advanced features for efficient, hands-off operation.A Python-based tool that captures Khan Academy exercise questions in Perseus JSON format using mitmproxy. This tool intercepts network traffic to extract the structured question data that Khan Academy uses internally.



## üöÄ Quick Start## Overview



```bashKhan Academy uses the Perseus format (developed internally) to represent interactive math and science questions. This scraper captures that data by:

# Test the enhanced scraper

python test_enhanced_scraper.py1. Setting up a local proxy server using mitmproxy

2. Intercepting Khan Academy API calls when you solve practice problems

# Run autonomous scraping (recommended)3. Extracting and saving Perseus JSON data for each question

python enhanced_khan_scraper.py "<exercise_url>" 1000 autonomous

## What Gets Captured

# Run legacy mode if needed

   - You'll see status messages in the terminal

3. **Start capturing questions:**
   - Navigate to any Khan Academy math exercise
   - Begin solving practice problems
   - Each question you encounter will be automatically captured and saved

4. **Stop when done:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
   - System proxy settings will be automatically restored

### Example Capture Session

```
$ ./run_capture.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------
Khan Academy Question Bank Scraper  
------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] This tool captures Perseus JSON data from Khan Academy exercises.
       Follow these steps:

1. Chrome will open to Khan Academy
2. Navigate to any math exercise (e.g., practice problems)  
3. Start answering questions - they'll be captured automatically
4. Press Ctrl+C here when done

Captured questions will be saved in: khan_academy_json/

```

## Output Structure

Captured questions are saved in the `khan_academy_json/` directory with filenames based on Khan Academy's internal question IDs:

```
khan_academy_json/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xa1b2c3d4e5f6789.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ xf9e8d7c6b5a4321.json  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ x123456789abcdef.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each JSON file contains the complete Perseus question structure. Here's an example from the included samples:

```json
{
  "answerArea": {
    "calculator": false,
    "chi2Table": false,
    "periodicTable": false,
    "tTable": false,
    "zTable": false
  },
  "question": {
    "content": "**Complete the table to make three equivalent expressions.**\n\n[[‚òÉ numeric-input 7]] $\\times8$ |\n$8+8$ |\n$2{}$ [[‚òÉ dropdown 4]]  |",
    "images": {},

            {"content": "fours", "correct": false}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "hints": [
    {
      "content": "$\\overset{\\greenD1}{\\blueD{8}} + \\overset{\\greenD2}{\\blueD{8}}$ is the same as $\\green2\\blueD{\\text{ eights}}$.",
      "images": {},

}
```

### Sample Questions Included

This repository includes 4 sample Khan Academy questions in the `khan_academy_json/` folder, demonstrating different widget types:
- **x0c8212a5c8672866.json**: Numeric input + dropdown widgets with LaTeX math
- **x301c5c7ddfd5ee0b.json**: Radio (multiple choice) widget with images  
- **xde44600a58981221.json**: Matcher widget for drag-and-drop pairing
- **x4199a21da4572c96.json**: Multiple image widgets with mathematical content

### Development History

See `INVESTIGATION_LOG.md` for detailed development history, including:
- API endpoint discovery process
- mitmproxy configuration challenges
- Perseus JSON structure analysis
- Widget type identification and cataloging
- Technical decisions and troubleshooting steps

This log provides valuable context for understanding how the scraper was developed and can guide future enhancements.

## Configuration

### Network Settings
The script automatically configures your system proxy settings. You can modify these in `run_capture.sh`:

```bash
PROXY_PORT="8080"           # mitmproxy listening port
PROXY_HOST="127.0.0.1"      # localhost
NETWORK_SERVICE="Wi-Fi"     # your network interface
```

### Chrome Profile
By default, the script opens a specific Chrome profile to avoid interfering with your regular browsing:

```bash  
CHROME_PROFILE_NAME="Profile 1"
```

### Output Directory
Questions are saved to the `khan_academy_json/` directory. You can change this in `capture_khan_json.py`:

```python
SAVE_DIRECTORY = "khan_academy_json"
```

## How It Works

### Technical Details

1. **Proxy Interception**: mitmproxy creates a local HTTP/HTTPS proxy server
2. **Traffic Analysis**: The script monitors specific Khan Academy API endpoints:
   - `getOrCreatePracticeTask` - Captures the list of questions in an exercise
   - `getAssessmentItem` - Captures individual question data as you encounter them
3. **Data Extraction**: Perseus JSON is extracted from the API response and saved locally
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: System proxy settings are restored when you exit

### API Endpoints Monitored

- **Practice Task Endpoint**: `api/internal/graphql/getOrCreatePracticeTask`
  - Provides the manifest of questions in an exercise session
  - Builds the list of question IDs to capture

- **Assessment Item Endpoint**: `api/internal/graphql/getAssessmentItem`  
  - Returns the complete Perseus JSON for individual questions
  - Triggered when you view/answer each question

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "mitmdump: command not found"**
```bash
pip install mitmproxy
```

**2. Chrome doesn't use proxy settings**
- Try restarting Chrome completely
- Check that system proxy is set: System Preferences > Network > Advanced > Proxies

**3. No questions being captured**
- Make sure you're on Khan Academy practice exercises (not videos or articles)
- Verify the terminal shows "Practice Task detected" message
- Try refreshing the exercise page

**4. Permission denied on script execution**
```bash
chmod +x run_capture.sh
```

**5. Proxy cleanup issues**
If proxy settings aren't restored properly:
```bash
networksetup -setwebproxystate "Wi-Fi" off
networksetup -setsecurewebproxystate "Wi-Fi" off
```

### Debugging

Enable verbose mitmproxy logging by modifying the last line in `run_capture.sh`:
```bash
mitmdump -v -s capture_khan_json.py --listen-port "$PROXY_PORT"
```

## Limitations

- **macOS Only**: Uses `networksetup` command for proxy configuration
- **Chrome Required**: Script is configured for Chrome browser
- **Perseus Format Only**: Only captures Perseus-formatted questions (not video content)
- **Network Dependent**: Requires stable internet connection to Khan Academy

## Legal Considerations

This tool is designed for educational and research purposes. Be sure to:

- Respect Khan Academy's Terms of Service
- Use captured data responsibly  
- Don't redistribute copyrighted content
- Consider reaching out to Khan Academy for official API access if doing large-scale research

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Question Selection

You can modify `capture_khan_json.py` to filter specific question types:

```python
def handle_assessment_item(self, flow: http.HTTPFlow):
    # Add filtering logic here
    item = data['data']['assessmentItem']['item']
    
    # Example: Only capture multiple choice questions
    if 'radio' in item['itemData']:
        # Save the question
        pass
```

### Bulk Processing

For processing multiple exercises:

1. Run the capture tool
2. Complete one full exercise session
3. Navigate to a new exercise type  
4. Repeat until you have desired coverage

### Data Analysis

The captured JSON files can be analyzed for:
- Question difficulty patterns
- Widget type distribution  
- Common mathematical topics
- Hint effectiveness strategies
