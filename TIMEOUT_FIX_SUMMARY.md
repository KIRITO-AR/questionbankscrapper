# Timeout Fix Summary - Khan Academy Scraper

## Problem Diagnosed
The `net::ERR_TIMED_OUT` errors were caused by mitmproxy acting as a bottleneck, slowing down network requests to the point of failure. The browser was timing out while downloading essential CSS, JavaScript, and fonts from Khan Academy.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Enhanced Selenium Timeout Configuration (`automate_exercise.py`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Increased timeouts significantly:**
  - Page load timeout: 90 seconds (was default ~30s)
  - Implicit wait: 20 seconds (was default ~10s)  
  - Explicit wait: 45 seconds (was 10-15s)
  - Element wait: 30 seconds (was 10-15s)

- **Added Chrome performance optimizations:**
  - `--disable-images` - Speed up loading
  - `--disable-javascript` - Disable non-essential JS
  - `--disable-extensions` - Reduce overhead
  - `--aggressive-cache-discard` - Optimize memory
  - `--disable-background-networking` - Reduce background requests

- **Enhanced error handling:**
  - Proper TimeoutException catching
  - Retry logic for page navigation (3 attempts)
  - More descriptive error messages
  - Graceful degradation when elements aren't found

### 2. ✅ Optimized Mitmproxy Performance (`capture_khan_json.py`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Reduced request delays:** 0.5s (was 1.0s)
- **Added concurrent request limiting:** Max 3 concurrent active requests
- **Background processing:** GraphQL processing in separate threads
- **Optimized headers:** Added connection keep-alive and compression
- **Smart filtering:** Only process Khan Academy requests
- **Enhanced mitmproxy settings:**
  - `--set connection_strategy=lazy` - Optimize connections
  - `--set stream_large_bodies=50m` - Stream large responses
  - `--set flow_detail=0` - Reduce logging overhead

### 3. ✅ Network Resilience (`main.py`)

**Changes Made:**
- **Pre-flight network testing:** Checks connectivity before starting
- **Enhanced startup process:** 15-second mitmproxy initialization wait
- **Retry logic:** Up to 3 attempts for mitmproxy startup
- **Better error messages:** Specific troubleshooting suggestions
- **Graceful cleanup:** Proper process termination on all exit paths

### 4. ✅ Verification System (`test_timeout_fixes.py`)

**Features Added:**
- Network connectivity testing
- Mitmproxy availability verification  
- Selenium dependency validation
- WebDriver manager functionality testing
- Complete script import verification

## Test Results

```
✓ Network Connectivity: Google & Khan Academy accessible
✓ Mitmproxy: v12.1.2 installed and working
✓ Selenium Dependencies: All available
✓ WebDriver Manager: ChromeDriver auto-install working
✓ Script Imports: All enhanced scripts import successfully
```

## Usage Instructions

### For Regular Use:
```bash
python main.py
```

### For Custom Exercise:
```bash
python main.py "https://www.khanacademy.org/math/..." 25
```

### To Test Before Running:
```bash
python test_timeout_fixes.py
```

## Expected Improvements

1. **Reduced Timeout Errors:** 45-second element waits should handle slow proxy responses
2. **Faster Page Loading:** Performance optimizations reduce resource usage
3. **Better Error Recovery:** Retry logic handles temporary network issues
4. **Clearer Diagnostics:** Enhanced error messages help identify root causes
5. **Automatic Validation:** Pre-flight checks catch issues before they cause failures

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you still encounter timeout issues:

1. **Check network connectivity:**
   ```bash
   python test_timeout_fixes.py
   ```

2. **Disable VPN/firewall temporarily** to rule out interference

3. **Reduce question count** for initial testing:
   ```bash
   python main.py "URL" 10
   ```

4. **Monitor system resources** during execution (Task Manager/Activity Monitor)

5. **Try without proxy** to isolate the issue:
   - Temporarily comment out proxy settings in `automate_exercise.py`
   - Run direct browser automation

The timeout fixes should resolve the `net::ERR_TIMED_OUT` errors by giving the browser sufficient time to download resources through the proxy while optimizing the proxy performance to reduce bottlenecks.
